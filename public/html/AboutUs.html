                kitesurfing, Samuele combines his academic interests with a
                dedication to environmental advocacy, questioning the status quo
                and igniting change. Samuele is a passionate force prepared to

                pursuing her dream of studying in an international environment.
                Her passion for running and outdoor activities has inspired her
                to become an advocate for the environment. She believes that
                everyone should take action to protect our planet, but
                understands that it can be overwhelming to look at the big
                picture. That’s why she’s excited about the inventions of
                EcoHero, which make it easy for people to make a difference in
                their own way.

                the age of 17, he left his home country, Venezuela, in pursuit
                of a dream, discover the word. His passion for football, hiking,
                cycling, and the gym, as well as his love for any sport he can
                share experiences, led him to create EcoHeroes. Eric is

              <p>
                Eliza is a 21-year-old GBE student from Poland. She moved to
                Denmark a little more than 2 years ago and she can honestly say
                that it was the best decision of her life. Eliza loves meeting
                new people; hearing about their lives and their experiences
                motivates her like nothing else. That passion inspired her and
                made her desire to make an impact on people’s everyday lives.
                Then, the opportunity to develop EcoHero came - a concept that
                ignited Eliza's passion for making a visible impact on people's
                everyday lives. The platform is not just a culmination of her
                aspirations; it's a testament to her unwavering commitment to
                making a meaningful difference in the world.

          <p class="text2">
            The idea of EcoHero was born out of a desire to address the growing
            concern over environmental issues. The team, consisting of four
            university students from Via University College Denmark, was tired
            of hearing about the problems facing our planet and the lack of
            action being taken to address them. They realized that many people
            want to help but don’t know where to start or feel overwhelmed by
            the scale of the problem. That’s how EcoHero began - as a way to
            help people find motivation for helping the planet by giving them
            small, achievable tasks that would encourage them to continue. The
            team, a combination of environmental fanatics and software
            developers, worked tirelessly to bring the EcoHero of today to life.
